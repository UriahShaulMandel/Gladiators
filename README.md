# Gladiators
My second programming project!

Created it in order to learn java more deeply, and learn OOP.
Worked on it at the start of 2017, 3 years ago, when I was 14 and just learned java. It took months, but was worth it :)

Inspired by the flash game [Swords and Sandals 2](http://swordandsandals.top/swords-and-sandals-2-full-version/) which my brother and I used to love when we were young.


Download it and play! It's really cool and actually fun.
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/UriahShaulMandel/Gladiators/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the folder
3. Double click `Gladiators.jar`, make sure it's in the same folder, or it won't be opened!
